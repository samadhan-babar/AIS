/**
 * @file CircularQueue.hpp
 * @brief Defines a template-based circular queue class for managing buffered data.
 * @details This file provides an implementation of a circular queue (or ring buffer) using a template,
 *          which allows for storing and managing elements in a buffer of fixed size. The queue supports push and pop operations
 *          and is commonly used in buffering scenarios like streaming data.
